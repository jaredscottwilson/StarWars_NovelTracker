# StarWars_NovelTracker
Script to track and provide updates on changes in Star Wars novel content

This script will use the following two domains as the basis for identifying the following cases:
1) A new book is added to Adult and Youth Novels
2) A book is removed from Adult and Youth Novels
3) A new book is added to the novels planned to be released
4) A book is removed to the novels planned to be released

https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_future_books

When a change is detected it emails the user what was changed.

You need to add your specific details to the empty config and rename it to config.py

Here's an example of the email when Legends content is added
