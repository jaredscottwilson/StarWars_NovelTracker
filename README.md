# Star_Wars_Tracker
Script to track and provide updates on changes in Star Wars novel content

This script will use the following two domains as the basis for identifying the following cases:
1) A new book is added to Canon Novels
2) A new book is added to Legends Novels
3) A new book is removed from Canon Novels
4) A new book is removed from Legends Novels

https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_books

https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_future_books

When a change is detected it emails the user what was changed.


Here's an example of the email when Legends content is added
